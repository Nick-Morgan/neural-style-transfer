    Returns a model for the purpose of 'painting' the picture.
    Takes only the convolution layer weights and wrap using the TensorFlow
    Conv2d, Relu and AveragePooling layer. VGG actually uses maxpool but
    the paper indicates that using AveragePooling yields better results.
    The last few fully connected layers are not used.
